To animate the title into view you call the **UIView** class method `animate(withDuration:animations:)`. The animation starts immediately and animates over half a second; you set the duration via the first method parameter in the code.

Itâ€™s as easy as that; all the changes you make to the view in the animations closure will be animated by UIKit.
